<h2>What is my cause?</h2>
  
<p>Happiness</p>
  </br>
<h2>Why is this my cause?</h2>

<p>Happiness is my cause because I believe that the most important factor in determining whether you are satisfied with 
what you are doing and where you are in life is making sure that you are happy where you are. Therefore my cause is to get
to a place where I am happy and to make sure I stay happy.</p>

<h2>First Set of Data(Over Three Different Years)</h2>

<a href = "2016.csv">Happiness Survey</a>

  <a href = "2015.csv">Happiness Survey 2</a>

  <a href = "2017.csv">Happiness Survey 3</a>
  </br>
<h2>What Does This Data Contain and What Do I Hope To Gain?</h2>

<p>This data shows countries listed from most happy to least happy. More importantly, the data provides different aspects 
about the country which are likely to affect happiness. In this way, it provides conections for what makes an overall 
population more happy, matching my cause. I hope to gain some insight into these factors through the data and my final project.

  <h2>Second Set of Data</h2> 

  <a href = "Original_hm.csv">Happiness Response Data</a>
  </br>
  <h2>What Does This Data Contain and What Do I Hope To Gain?</h2>
  <p>This data containts a plethora of different respondents from the United States answering the question "What made you happy
    today?". This is a good way to see how people view happiness in their lives. I hope to gain some 
    knowledge about the different things which influence someone being happy on any given day.</p>

  found infomation by looking for databases for happiness on google and managed to find my second set of data through
  this method. Check out Kaggle for your own cause :) and good luck</p>
