<h2>What is my cause?</h2>
<p>Happiness</p>
<h2>Why is this my cause?</h2>
<p>Happiness is my cause because I believe that the most important factor in determining whether you are satisfied with 
what you are doing and where you are in life is making sure that you are happy where you are. Therefore my cause is to get
to a place where I am happy and to make sure I stay happy.</p>
<h2>What data have I found about happiness?</h2>

<h2>How does this data relate to my cause?<h2>
  <p>This data shows countries listed from most happy to least happy. More importantly, the data provides different areas 
    about the country which are likely to affect happiness. In this way, it provides evidence for what makes an overall 
    population more happy, matching the cause that drives me.</p>
