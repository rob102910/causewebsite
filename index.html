<h2>What is my cause?</h2>
<p>Happiness</p>
<h2>Why is this my cause?</h2>
<p>Happiness is my cause because I believe that the most important factor in determining whether you are satisfied with 
what you are doing and where you are in life is making sure that you are happy where you are. Therefore my cause is to get
to a place where I am happy and to make sure I stay happy.</p>
