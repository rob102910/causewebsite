<h2>What are two mistakes that people often make when creating visualizations with maps?</h2>
  <img src="smile.jpg">
  
<h2>Mistake One</h2>

<p>One mistake that people often make when creating visualizations with maps is choosing an inappropriate projection for the purpose of the map. For example, if someone chooses a Goode homolosine projection trying to show the area of the world with temperatures lower than 0 degrees in the winter, the area would be seen as much smaller than is realistically there. Thus, this would be an inappropriate projection to be chosen, and would need to be revised. </p>
</br>
<h2>Mistake Two</h2>

  <p>Another mistake which is common when creating visualizations with maps is increases representative objects in an incorrect manor. This is especially true when dealing with circles, as increasing by two times radius to represent something twice as large will give an area four times the size. This skews larger areas and is therefore done incorrectly.  </p>
  </br>
<h2>Mistake Three</h2>

<p>Another mistake when creating visualization with representative symbols is having overlapping symbols. It is hard for humans to tell area, and this is even harder when things overlap and are hard to see. Thus, it is better practice to slightly offset the symbols or make them see thru in order to properly be able to tell the differences in area. 
  </p>
</br>
  <h2>Mistake Four</h2> 

<p>Another common mistake is in choosing color schemes. It is easy to choose colors which get darker to the point that the darkest color seems to show a high concentration of what is being measured. However, this may not be the case with the data that is being worked on. Therefore, default color schemes should not be used, and the actual data density should be considered when choosing color. </p>
