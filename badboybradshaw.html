<h2>Present an essay for Chapter 3 and present a situation in which a lie allowed you to tell the truth better.</h2>
  <img src="smile.jpg">
  
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Chapter three discusses how any visualization is a model. This means they are not exact replicas of what is being presented. A model is a sign, or a set of signs and their relationships that describes, explains, or predicts something about how nature works with a variable degree of accuracy. When creating a map of the world, some aspects must be exaggerated in order to gain a better understanding of how the globe really looks. Models can be better than others by being more truthful, accurate, informative, or understandable. One important factor in making sure that information is not skewed is by making the data relative instead of using the absolute numbers. Another is making sure to include all relevant information which may skew the data in one way or another. A good rule in looking at the complexity of a model is instead of oversimplifying information, models should clarify it.  </p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

  <p>Cairo states the challenge of visualizations being in that we snap-judgements whether we have the necessary knowledge for it or not.
  </p><p>
  These judegements come down to three things…</p><p>

1. We detect interesting patterns, regardless of whether or not they are real. I’ll call this the patternicity bug. 
2. We immediately come up with a coherent explanation for those patterns. This is the storytelling bug. 
3. We start seeing all further information we receive, even the one that conflicts with our explanation, in a way that confirms it. We refuse to give our explanations up, no matter what. This is the confirmation bug.

<h2>Visualizations as representations of the truth</h2>

<p>
</p>
  
  <h2>One situation where a lie allows you to tell the truth better</h2> 

<p>Imagine you are a secret agent and have just gotten word of a possible plot to kill the president. You have no evidence behind the attack, but your intuition has never led you wrong and you are willing to risk your reputation on it. It is therefore your duty to get to him/her as fast as possible. You see the president on stage in the middle of an important speak, in front of a crowd and know they are in immediate danger. However, it is impossible for you to run on stage as guards block your path. You know you must lie to those guards and tell them you saw someone with a weapon at the south entrance. This allows you to more accurately tell the truth, which is the president is in possible danger and enable them to take action, getting the president to safety. With this, you have made the right call, seeing a man trying to make it out unnoticed as the president is being led away. This is the suspect you knew was hiding. Quickly, you get to the man, unarm him and save the day. Another plot safely dealt with.

  <h2>Another...</h2>
  <p>Imagine Bad Boy Bradshaw has given you an assignment due at midnight. You finish the assignment with an hour to go and are about to turn it in. Yet, as you prepare to, you hear a dog bark loudly outside your dorm. You wonder, what could all the racket possibly be about? You walk outside to see a large menacing dog standing over a defenseless student. It couldn’t be, the legendary Centre hound, which stalks the night searching for freshman to terrorize. You make the heroic effort to push the hound away and tell the student to run inside quickly. You are relieved to see them make it but are brought back to the reality of your situation as the hound proceeds to get aggressive and pin you to the floor. With a side kick and a quick roll, you are able to make it on your feet. You run towards the door but the hound is faster, blocking your path and forcing you to back up slowly. You know you must find another way. Knowing your speed, the look in the hound’s eyes, and the situation, you make a decision. You slowly approach the dog, but instead of attacking, you lower yourself and place your hand out. You see the dogs confused eyes and hope the risk will pay off. It could be that this hound wasn’t so bad after all, and you make the daring risk. As the hound sniffs your hand, you smile, thinking you have made the right decision. Then the hound’s white fangs sink deep into your hand, you scream, and do all you can to get the hound off. As you do, you see the hound get pulled off, and someone comes to your side. The student you helped has brought many other students to your rescue. They comfort you as they make arrangements to get you to the hospital. The student you saved stays with you the whole time. You learn her name was Elizabeth, a freshman who tried feeding the legendary Centre hound. With a few stiches, you leave glowing, knowing you were able to save someone with your actions. Not even the tiredness which results from the late time is able to change your mood. But wait, what about your assignment? There is no way Bradshaw would believe the encounter of the Centre hound! You aren’t even a freshman. Panic sets in. Calm down, calm down. You are a Centre student, there must be a way you can make the story more believable. You go to sleep thinking about the situation. When you arrive at class the next morning, Bradshaw brings the assignment to your attention, given that you never miss a deadline. You explain calmly that you have your assignment with you completed. You go on to explain that the absence of the turn in was due to your hospital visit caused by a gruesome attack by the Centre hawk, the feared legendary creature which stalks the night looking for sophomores to pray on. Bradshaw, knowing your sophomore status, completely understands the situation and allows the late work with sincere apology for the unfortunate run in. You thank him and sit down, thinking of Elizabeth and how hard you ended up trying for a simple prep 
